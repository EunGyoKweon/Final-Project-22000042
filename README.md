# Final-Project-22000042
<h2>1. What does this project do? </h2>

This project is a shopping mall that introduces and sells eco-friendly products. 
Through eco-friendly shopping malls, people can learn various eco-friendly products and purchase them easily and quickly. 
Also, people can be more interested in eco-friendly products and eco-friendly companies than before, and this business can promote people's eco-friendly consumption.
Therefore, it can cause positive social changes by informing the need for eco-friendly products and encouraging the use of eco-friendly products.

<h2>2. Why is this project useful?</h2> 

As environmental pollution becomes serious, consumer awareness of people is gradually changing. 
People are very interested in eco-friendly consumption to prevent global environmental pollution. 
Also, many people are aware of the growing need for more sustainable products throughout the world to help protect the environment.
And as the delivery industry continues to evolve, our online shopping mall is expected to be of infinite potential and useful use. 
Therefore, I think my shopping mall will be useful enough because people's interest in eco-friendly products is increasing, the online market is expanding, and the business prospects for eco-friendly products are promising in the future.

1. I implemented the "mail.html" part myself using html, css and JavaScript language.
   -> mail.html path: html/batflat/default
   -> I completed the whole project by myself without using anyone else's source code.

2. From the template provided by Batflat by default, we have changed many things, including background color, blog settings, navigation settings, page settings, and configuration.
